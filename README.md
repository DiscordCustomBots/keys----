# Discord Auth Bot V2
Discord Auth Bot V2 is a new and improved version of my original discord auth bot. This project is written with the Node.js framework as opposed to using java, making it much easier to setup.

My goals for this project:
  - Easier to setup
  - Nice, browser based UI to manage server
  - Easy to integrate with discord

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have npm installed (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- Make sure you have yarn installed (https://yarnpkg.com/en/) 
- Make sure you have gatsby installed (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) 

## Installation
Run the following commands to install
* Quick note: If you are on a mac or linux machine, you may need to run the following commands with sudo in front of them (i.e. sudo npm install)


```sh
npm install
gatsby develop
```
